      <p>Hi, my name is Xiwei Huang. Wuhan born and bred. Product of the late-2000s MP3/4 generation. Glass half-full kind of gal. Recently a media art master graduate from NYU. Before that I spent my days and nights studying theories in mass communication and researching on cognitive psychology at UCB.</p>
      <p>Mostly working for creating better experiences we have with today's fancy technology, also spent some time building kinetic installations and designing 3D content.</p>
      <p>Enjoying the life being a habitual observer, drinking way too many coffee to stay sane. Thrived in lots of failures and some accomplishments. Open to big ideas and surprising endeavors.</p>
          
      <p><a href="mailto:xiwei.huang@nyu.edu">Talk</a> to me if you feel the same way as I do.</p>
