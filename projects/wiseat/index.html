      <h2>Background/ Design Problem</h2>
      <p anchor=1>
        Not enough today's mobile apps are made to increase the quality of senior's everyday life nor enough amount of senior groups are considered as center of the target users for many popular apps. The reasons might be obvious: they aren't technology savvies nor they want to be. But the fact i learned through a series of interviews and researches conducted for my <i>Design For Senior</i> class however showed the opposite: <b>Seniors in the US are very much up-to-date to today's mobile technology</b> . Almost everyone in our interview group has smart phones and they all are craving for some apps that would help them to improve their life qualities. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So we felt we want to do something for this often being neglacetd group, from many topics, we distilled down to one specific <b>design challenge</b> : <b>How can help senior leave alone and cook at home to plan their meals healthier, and futhur to increase their nutritional awareness.</b>
      </p>

      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <p>
        We started by asking a few of them what are the daily challenge in their meal planing. Most of them do cook at home but don't have tailored recipes towards their needs. And it is very expensive to go out and seek for professional meal planning service.
      </p>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p anchor=2>
        To motivate seniors to get better nutrition intake through healthy recipe sharing.
